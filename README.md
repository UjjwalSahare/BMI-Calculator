HTML
The HTML file  the essential components of the user interface. It includes:

A container element that holds the input fields and the button.
Two <label> elements to prompt the user to enter their weight and height.
An <input> field for the user to input their weight in kilograms.
An <input> field for the user to input their height in cm.
A button element that triggers the BMI calculation when clicked.

CSS
The CSS file is used to style the BMI Calculator, ensuring that the user interface is visually appealing and user-friendly. Key styling elements include:

Centering the container on the page.
Adding padding and margin for a clean layout.
Customizing the appearance of input fields and the button to improve usability.

JavaScript
JavaScript is employed to handle the logic of the BMI calculation. The core tasks handled by JavaScript include:

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript is used to capture user inputs (weight and height) through the DOM and to display the calculated BMI dynamically.
Event Handling: The button element listens for a click event. When the button is clicked, the script retrieves the user input values, performs the BMI calculation, and displays the result.
Conditional Logic: The script uses if-else conditions to validate user input and to classify the BMI result into different categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight).
